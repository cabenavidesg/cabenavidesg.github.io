Hello! I’m Carlos A. Benavides-Gallego

I began studying a B.Sc. in physics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogotá. Then, in 2014, I obtained an MSc. in Astronomy at the Observatorio Astronomico Nacional from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. From 2013 to 2017, I worked as a lecturer at different universities in Bogota, such as Universidad Konrad Lorenz, Universidad Catolica de Colombia, and Escuela de Ingenieros Militares (ESING). As a lecturer at Universidad Konrad Lorenz, I participated in two projects for science dissemination in high schools, where we guided students to build radio and Newtonian telescopes. 

In 2017, I moved to Shanghai, China, to pursue a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Fudan University under the supervision of Prof. Cosimo Bambi. My research work during my PhD was related to black holes, new black hole solutions, particle motion, gravitational lensing, and alternative theories of gravity. Moreover, I had the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues, participate in scientific discussions, and gain experience in the scientific research process. 

From 2020-2024, I continued my research journey as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I expanded my research work to wormholes and gravitational waves. As a Postdoc, I mentored graduate students from different Universities, guiding them in the research process and preparation of manuscripts for publications. Currently, I focus on exploring the image and shadow of black holes within various spacetimes, combining theoretical insights with programming techniques. Furthermore, I am interested in studying machine learning techniques related to black hole astrophysics.   
	
In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching. Research is a pedagogical experience in itself. In this sense, it is essential to design courses that closely align with research needs, allowing students to become familiar with the research process earlier and develop critical and analytical thinking skills. I am particularly interested in developing courses such as general relativity, tensor calculus, and black holes theory with programming applications.
	
Finally, I believe Universities should participate in projects that promote science dissemination. These initiatives are an excellent way to motivate and inspire younger generations from diverse cultures, races, and ethnicities, fostering a society based on respect, tolerance, and friendship. In this regard, my experience can help to bring education closer to society.
