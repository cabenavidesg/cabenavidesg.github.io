## Abstrac
<div style="text-align:justify">
    Black hole accretion distks are crretnly a topic of widespread interest in astrophysics and are suppose to play and important role in a number of high-energy situations. The present paper contains an investigation of the optical appearance of a spherical black hole sourrounde by a thin accretion disk. Isoradial curves corresponding to photons emitted at constant radius from the hole as seen by a distant observer in arbitrary direction have been plotted, as well as spectral shifts arising from gravitational and doppler shifts. By the results of Page and Thorne (1974) the relative intrisinc intensiy of radiation emitted by the disk at a given radius is a known function of the radius only, so that it is possible to calculate the exact distribution of observerd  bolometric flux. Direct and secondary images are plotted and the strong asymmetry in the flux distribution due to the rotation of the disk  is exhibited. Finally, a simulated photograph is constructed, valid for black holes of any mass accreting matter at any moferate rate.
    
## MathJax

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
